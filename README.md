## How to Use

To use QwikLink:
- Go to the website ![here](https://byrdsr1.github.io/qwiklink). 
- Next, allow the usage of your device's camera (QwikLink needs to be able to see the link)
- Center the text you wish to scan in the blue box, the click "Get URL!"
- Once the blue progress bar is full, edit the link that appears at the bottom of your screen if necessary
- Finally, click "Go!" to go to the link

## Credits

QwikLink wouldn't work without ![Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js). Tesseract is a really cool piece of software and I recommend playing around with it either by using it in an app or on their ![website](https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/).

QwikLink also uses:
- ![Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) for responsive design
- Github Pages for site hosting
